/**
 * This annotates <i>adapter</i> classes. These are classes that are used to supply methods for Java types when they
 * don't have a method that their Javascript counterpart has. For example for Number in Javascript you can do
 * number.toFixed(2). As in Java this method does not exist and as the Java Number-derived classes are all final, the
 * only alternative is to put this method in another class - an adapter class. All the methods of an adapter class must
 * have their first parameter the object to which the method is applied. The other parameters are the parameters
 * normally supplied to the Javascript method. For the number.toFixed example, the adapter will have a method
 * NumberAdapter.toFixed(String number, int position). The generated javascript code is the expected one:
 * number.toFixer(position).
 * 
 * Note: The adapter's method must be all static.
