This is the STJS project (http://st-js.sourceforge.net/) with some customizations to be used with next framework.
These customizations include some API flexibilities and Next Objects (org.nextframework.js.NextGlobalJs.next).
This project is not required to be available at runtime. But there are js files that must be generated and copied.
The js files are generated at the org.nextframework.view/resources
